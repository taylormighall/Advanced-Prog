# MNIST Digit Predictor

This programme aims to fufil 2 Use Cases:
1. User uploads an image of a handwritten digit for recognition
2. User draws a digit using mouse inside the canvas area

It will then predict the digit uploaded or drawn in the Canvas Area after you press the Predict button. 

Make sure the MNIST images and labels are in the correct folder as they are in the git project so they can be loaded correctly.
The project has no further requirements to make it run
